## Notes

It's better to install `Solana Tool Suite` and `Anchor` on Linux rather than Windows. On Windows, we can use `WSL` for Linux environment. Otherwise, tricky challenges are expected while installing those tools.

### Solana CLI

The main things we'll be doing with the Solana CLI will be configuring our network (between localhost and a developer testnet) as well as airdropping tokens into our wallets, pretty much everything else we'll be doing with the Anchor CLI.

You need to be sure your wallet is using the same network that your local environment is using when testing.

```bash
solana config get # We can check the current network (and other) configuration.

# We can change the network like so:
solana config set --url localhost # Set to localhost
solana config set --url devnet # Set to devnet

solana address # We can see our current local wallet address.
solana account <address from above> # And then get the full details about an account.
```

```bash
solana config set --url localhost # Switch to the local network

# This is going to be a local Solana node that we can deploy to for testing.
solana-test-validator # Start the local network

# Once the local network is running, you can airdrop tokens to your account. With the network running, open a separate window and run the following command.
solana airdrop 100

# You can the check the balance of your wallet:
solana balance
# or
solana balance <address>
```

### Building the program

```bash
anchor build # Compile the program

# Before we continue to test and deploy the program, we want to get the dynamically generated Program ID that was generated by the build.
solana address -k target/deploy/example1-keypair.json

anchor test # Test the program

anchor deploy # Deploy the program (be sure that `solana-test-validator` is running)

# You can view the validator logging by opening a separate window and running this command:
solana logs
```

## Development

```bash
yarn install
```
